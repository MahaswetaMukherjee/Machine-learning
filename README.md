Bias - Variance - Trade off - Over fitting - Under fitting:

Bias : Jokhon Ekta machine learning model training data set a onek besi bhul kore take bole bias. Training a bhul korle to test data set a bhul hobei 

Picture a High bias fig1, mid bias fig2, low bias fig3 

Variance: Error difference between Training and test data set.

Example : Suppose Train data te error elo 10, Test data the error elo 100
Variance = Error of Test data - Error of Train data = 100-10 = 90

Picture a High variance fig3 Cause training data set a onek best bhalo perform korche to test a bhul korbe chance besi(Ekta student j exam a book ratta mere geche chances high thake je ektu ghuriye question korle 
Se bhul korbei besi) 
, mid variance fig2 Training a motamoti data pattern capture koreche so test a average error korbe. (Average student porasona o average koreche score o average kore)

,low variance fig1 Training a bhul korle to test data set a bhul hobei(Ekta bindas student je porasona e kore ni this kore aber question tough ele exam a kharap korbei by default)

Over fitting : Model do very well in training data set but do very bad in test data 
Under fitting : Model perform very poor in both training and test data 

We need low bias and low variance data.

In figure 2 model do average in training as well as testing  this is called bias variance trade off. We need this kind of model.
